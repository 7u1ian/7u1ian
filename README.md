Hi, Iâ€™m @7u1ian

I'm a CS student at USC class of 2023 and attended Hack Reaector
SEI Coding Boot Camp this past summer. I'm also a 6-year Navy
veteran where I worked as an Electronic Technician specializing
in satellite communuications.

I'm currently making a scheduling web app that helps groups find
a common time to meet. It's almost feature complete!

I'm seeking an internship in full stack web development for
Spring or Summer 2022.
